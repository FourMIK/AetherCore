# AetherCore v0.2.0 - First Published Package

**Classification:** OPERATIONAL (Alpha Release)  
**Release Date:** February 12, 2026  
**TRL:** 6-7 (System/Subsystem Development)

---

## 🎉 Inaugural Release

This is the **first published package** of AetherCore, a hardware-rooted trust fabric for contested environments. AetherCore replaces "trust by policy" with **Cryptographic Certainty** for autonomous swarms, critical infrastructure, and edge operations.

---

## ⚡ Key Capabilities

### 🛡️ Hardware-Rooted Identity
Every node is cryptographically bound to physical silicon via TPM 2.0 / Secure Enclave. No software-only identity chains.

### 🔗 Merkle Vine™ Integrity
Telemetry streams are historically anchored. Data cannot be injected retroactively. Every event contains a hash of its ancestor.

### ⚡ The Aetheric Sweep
Automated gossip protocols actively hunt and isolate compromised or "lying" nodes. Byzantine detection is continuous and automatic.

### 🖥️ Tactical Glass
GPU-accelerated desktop dashboard providing real-time fleet command and mesh visualization. Built with Tauri for native performance.

### 🔐 Zero-Trust Architecture
- Fail-visible mode: Unverified data is explicitly marked as `STATUS_UNVERIFIED` or `SPOOFED`
- No silent integrity failures
- If identity verification fails, the node is considered an adversary

---

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Cryptographic Foundation
- **Hashing:** BLAKE3 exclusively (SHA-256 deprecated and removed)
- **Signing:** Ed25519 with TPM-backed private keys (CodeRalphie)
- **Transport:** TLS 1.3 enforced in production mode
- **Memory Safety:** Rust core with zero-copy optimization

### Architecture (4MIK Architectural Invariants)
✓ **No Mocks in Production:** Systematic replacement of all simulation with real gRPC/FFI calls  
✓ **Memory Safety:** Rust is the source of truth for edge execution  
✓ **Hashing:** BLAKE3 exclusively throughout the stack  
✓ **Signing:** TPM-backed Ed25519 (CodeRalphie). Private keys never in system memory  
✓ **Data Structure:** All data streams structured as Merkle Vines  
✓ **Fail-Visibility:** No graceful degradation for security failures

### Services
- **Identity Service** - TPM attestation gate for all nodes
- **Stream Processing** - Integrity tracking for telemetry
- **H2 Ingest Service** - High-throughput telemetry ingestion
- **C2 Router** - Command and control with signature verification
- **Trust Mesh** - Gossip-based Byzantine detection

Download from: https://github.com/FourMIK/AetherCore/releases/tag/v0.2.0

### Building from Source

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, Rust 1.75+, pnpm
git clone https://github.com/FourMIK/AetherCore.git
cd AetherCore
git checkout v0.2.0

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build desktop application
cd packages/dashboard
pnpm tauri build
```

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed instructions.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Alpha Release)

This is an **Alpha Release** for evaluation and testing:

1. **Dev Mode Default:** The desktop application runs in "Dev Mode" by default, simulating hardware roots of trust
2. **TPM Validation Optional:** Hardware TPM validation can be enabled but is not enforced
3. **Single-Node Focus:** Multi-node mesh coordination is functional but not optimized
4. **Transport:** HTTP/WS supported for development (HTTPS/WSS recommended for production)
5. **Hardware Pairing:** ESP32 device pairing requires manual configuration

---

## 🔒 Security Posture

### Production-Ready Components
- Cryptographic primitives (BLAKE3, Ed25519)
- Merkle Vine integrity system
- Identity verification protocols
- Byzantine node detection algorithms

### Development-Mode Components
- Simulated TPM for testing without hardware
- HTTP/WebSocket support for local development
- SQLite database (PostgreSQL recommended for production)

### Security Hardening
See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for:
- Threat model and attack surface analysis
- Security assumptions and limitations
- Incident response procedures
- Responsible disclosure policy

This release represents the culmination of rigorous architectural work adhering to 4MIK AetherCore Architect principles:
- Zero tolerance for mocks in production paths
- Memory safety as a first principle
- Cryptographic certainty over policy-based trust
- Fail-visible integrity verification
- Hardware-rooted identity for all nodes

The system is designed for environments where trust cannot be assumed and cryptographic proof is mandatory.
