> **AetherCore** is a hardware-rooted trust fabric for contested environments. 
> **Tactical Glass** is the operator's window into that truth.

## ⚠️ Alpha Release Notice
This is a **Developer Preview (v0.1.0)**. While the cryptographic core is verified, this software is intended for evaluation and testing in controlled environments. 
* **Dev Mode:** The desktop application currently runs in "Dev Mode" by default, simulating hardware roots of trust.
* **Compatibility:** Hardware pairing requires Firmware v0.1.0+.

---

## Overview

AetherCore replaces "trust by policy" with **Cryptographic Certainty**. It is designed for autonomous swarms, critical infrastructure, and edge operations where network integrity is paramount.

### Key Capabilities

* **🛡️ Hardware-Rooted Identity:** Every node is cryptographically bound to physical silicon (TPM 2.0 / Secure Enclave).
* **🔗 Merkle Vine™ Integrity:** Telemetry streams are historically anchored; data cannot be injected retroactively.
* **⚡ The Aetheric Sweep:** Automated gossip protocols actively hunt and isolate compromised or "lying" nodes.
* **🖥️ Tactical Glass:** A GPU-accelerated desktop dashboard for real-time fleet command and mesh visualization.

## Quick Start

## First Run & Configuration

Upon launching Tactical Glass, you will enter the Command Dashboard.

### Node Deployment (Local)
1. Navigate to the **Deployments** tab in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add Node**.
3. Select **Local Process** to spawn a node on your machine.
4. The node will automatically connect to the local mesh loopback.

### Hardware Pairing (ESP32)
Requires Firmware v0.1.0 flashed to device.

1. Ensure your computer and ESP32 are on the same Wi-Fi network.
2. In Dashboard, click **Add Node > Hardware Scan**.
3. Point your webcam at the QR code generated by the device (if applicable) or enter the Pairing Code.

## Troubleshooting

### "Developer Mode" Warning
You will see a "DEV MODE" banner at the top of the application. This is normal for the Alpha release and indicates that hardware security modules (TPM) are being emulated in software for compatibility.

### Connection Failed
If you cannot deploy nodes:
* Ensure ports 8080 and 9000-9100 are not blocked by your firewall.
* Check the logs in the Deployments view for specific error messages.

## Dashboard Production Docker Image

A production-ready dashboard container is available via a multi-stage build (`node:20-alpine` builder + `nginx:alpine` runtime) with runtime environment injection.

### Build

```bash
docker build -t aethercore-dashboard -f docker/Dockerfile.dashboard .
```

### Run

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e REACT_APP_API_URL="https://api.example.mil" \
  -e REACT_APP_WS_URL="wss://ws.example.mil" \
  aethercore-dashboard
```

### Verify

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/env.js
```

`/env.js` is rendered at container startup, so API/WebSocket endpoints can be changed without rebuilding the image.
